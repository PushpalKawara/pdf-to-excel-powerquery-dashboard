# pdf-to-excel-powerquery-dashboard
This project is a demonstration of how raw data from a PDF can be converted into a structured Excel file and then presented in a clean dashboard format.   It is created as a sample to showcase my skills in Excel, Power Query, data cleaning, and dashboard reporting.   All files in this repository use dummy data only.
