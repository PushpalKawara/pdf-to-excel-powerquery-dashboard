# Excel Data Cleaning & Dashboard Project

This project is a demonstration of how raw data from a PDF can be converted into a structured Excel file and then presented in a clean dashboard format.  
It is created as a sample to showcase my skills in Excel, Power Query, data cleaning, and dashboard reporting.  
All files in this repository use dummy data only.
